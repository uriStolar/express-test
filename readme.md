# Test Driven Development with ExpressJS

This little project tries to put together several JavaScript technologies
in order to learn a workflow for doing Test Driven Development (TDD).

The technologies used are the following:

* [NodeJS](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
* [ExpressJS](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
* [SuperTest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest)
* [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha)

To run the tests simply `cd` into your project directory and run `npm test`.
